# Saturn
This repo contains the code to build the Saturn Backend, Launcher, and Client for all supported platforms, as well as the source to the file provider, manifest parser, and uasset API used to edit assets.

## What is Saturn?
Saturn is the most advanced Fortnite Skin Changer on the market and is completely free! Items get automatically added to the swapper when EPIC adds them to Fortnite allowing you to change skins without having to wait for a contributor to add them to the program. The UI is made in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript combining the smooth navigation of a website with the benefits of a native app.
