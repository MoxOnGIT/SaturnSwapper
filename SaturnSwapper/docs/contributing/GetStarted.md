* **DO** follow our [coding style](https://github.com/Tamely/SaturnSwapper/blob/master/docs/contributing/CodingStyle.md)
* **DO** test your implementation before making a pull request
* **DO** mark an line with `// TODO: ` or `// FIXME: ` to indicate a task that needs to be done and you weren't able to finish it then let us know in the pull request thread
* **DO** post in [Saturn's Discord](https://discord.gg/SaturnSwapper) about your contribution and how it helps the project as we might be able to share insight with you on how to improve or better align your idea with the current project

### Suggested Workflow

We use and recommend the following workflow:
1. Create an issue for your work on this repo or post about it in [Saturn's Discord](https://discord.gg/SaturnSwapper).
    - You can skip this step for trivial changes.
    - Reuse an existing issue on the topic if you can.
    - Get agreement from project maintainers that your issue is worth working on or that no one else is working on it.
    - Clearly state that you are going to be implementing it if you are not just filing a bug report.
2. Create a personal fork of this repo (if you don't have one already).
3. In your fork, create a branch off of **master** (`git checkout -b <branch-name>`).
    - Name the branch so that it clearly indicates your intentions, such as `broken-beta-detection-1`.
    - Branches are useful since they isolate your work from incoming changes from upstream. They also enable you to create multiple pull requests from the same fork.
4. Make and commit your changes to the branch.
    - [Workflow Instructions](https://github.com/Tamely/SaturnSwapper/blob/master/docs/contributing/BuildingAndRunning.md) explains how to build and test your changes.
5. Build the repository with your changes.
    - Make sure that the builds are clean.
    - Make sure that everything implemented works as expected.
6. Create a pull request against the Tamely/SaturnSwapper repository's **master** branch.
    - State in the description what issue or improvement you are addressing.
7. Wait for feedback or approval of your changes from the project maintainers.
8. When the project maintainers have approved, your pull request will be merged.
    - The next official release will include your change.
    - You can delete the branch you used to make your changes.
