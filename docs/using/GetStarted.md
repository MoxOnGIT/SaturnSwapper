# Getting Started

## Downloading
Navigate to and download the latest release in [releases](https://github.com/Tamely/SaturnSwapper/releases).
    - You can either download the source code (labeled `Source code (zip)`) under the release and compile Saturn for yourself, or you can download `Saturn.zip` for the pre-compiled binaries.
    - If you downloaded the pre-compiled binaries, just extract `Saturn.zip` to any location you please and run `Saturn.exe` from the newly extracted folder.

## Running
Saturn does not usually require any outside interference. This means you do not have to turn off your antivirus, or download anything other than [WebView 2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section) which comes with Windows 11.
    - Just run `Saturn.exe` obtained from the download section. If this does not work, please go through `Support` in [Saturn's Official Discord](https://discord.gg/SaturnSwapper)

## Setting Up
Due to how advanced Saturn is, it requires a little bit of set up in the swapper. Usually, if it's your first time running the swapper, it will take you through a tutorial that should get you all set up. If this is not the case, or it's not your first time running it, these instructions may help:
    - Get a key by clicking `Get Key` on the `Dashboard`, and paste it into the key box
        - NOTE: Nothing is supposed to happen when you paste it, everything is done in the background. If you pasted it right, it will work
    - Navigate to the `Settings` tab and click `Add Cosmetics`. You want to add all the items you `own` here. Press `Back` at the top right when you're finished
    - Navigate to the `Cosmetics` tab and click whatever cosmetic you `want`. After it generates options, it will pop up with the items you `own` that can be swapped to the item you `want`. Click which item you want to swap.
    - Navigate to the `Settings` tab and click `Launch Fortnite`

## After Launching Fortnite
Saturn uses a launcher so nothing is swapped permanantly. Every swap you do with Saturn will get reverted once you close Fortnite. To make sure this is the case, DO NOT CLOSE THE LAUNCHER. It will close by itself once Fortnite closes.
